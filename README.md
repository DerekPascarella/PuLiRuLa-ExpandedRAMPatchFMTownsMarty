<h1>Pu-Li-Ru-La</h1>

<img align="right" width="156" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/Pu-Li-Ru-La-Expanded-RAM-Patch-FM-Towns-Marty/blob/main/cover.jpg?raw=true">This patch allows the game "Pu-Li-Ru-La" to run with extended features when using an aftermarket 2MB RAM addon with the FM Towns Marty.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, the game does both a memory check and a machine-type check. If one of the following conditions is met, "Pu-Li-Ru-La" is locked to 2MB mode.

<ul>
  <li>Fewer than 2MB of RAM is present.</li>
  <li>The game is running on an FM Towns Marty.</li>
  <li>The game is running on a first-generation FM Towns desktop.</li>
</ul>

This patch removes that check, thus forcing the game to boot into "3MB of RAM or greater" mode, no matter what.
<br><br>
The following changes can be observed with "Pu-Li-Ru-La" running in this extended RAM mode.

<ul>
  <li>The anti-infinite-combo enemy Sokushin Boots will now spawn when you linger on bosses or abuse juggles.</li>
  <li>Three sound-effect samples that are absent in 2 MB mode are loaded and played.</li>
  <li>The large parallax layer at the start of Stage 6 is fully present instead of being cut.</li>
  <li>Both rare screen-clearing magic attacks, "Rapman" and "Mr. MIKATA", become available again.</li>
  <li>The game can keep its bigger graphics and audio in memory, so the four mid-stage CD load pauses disappear, giving seamless play.</li>
</ul>
